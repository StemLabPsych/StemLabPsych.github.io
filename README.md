# mathtask.html

- This serves as my primary diligence task. It integrates with qualtrics and allows participants to solve math problems, receiving correctness feedback. Participants can choose to look at comics (hosted on qualtrics), and they can choose to skip problems. After 4 minutes participants are redirected back to my F18 qualtrics study (part 3/3).

# mathPractice.html

- This is very similar to the primary diligence task, `mathtask.html`, but it doesn't allow people to skip problems and doesn't give comics options. Instead, participants solve as many problems as they can in 2 minutes, and are then redirected to my F18 qualtrics study (part 2/3)

# ch.html

- This contains a version of the diligence task for the Fungus paradigm. It's currently configured to redirect to Cameron's F18 qualtrics.

# mathdemo.html

- This contains an outdated version of the diligence task for math, intended to share with collaborators, as it does not redirect to a study.
